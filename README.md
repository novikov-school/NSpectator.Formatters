NSpectator is inspired by [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) and originally based on [NSpec](https://github.com/mattflo/NSpec) BDD framework for .NET of the xSpec (context/specification) flavor. NSpectator is intended to be used to drive development through specifying behavior at the unit level. 
NSpectator using more flexible [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/fluentassertions) library. It`s important not to depend on specific unit test framework.
